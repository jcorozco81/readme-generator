    Professional README file generator
  

  
## Description
***

  In order to help the professional developers to have better use of their time, an automated Read Me file generator was created. The **Professional README Generator** prompts the user for a series of questions such as Project Title, repository name, user contact information, type of project, type of license, and other required information that will be used to create the readme structure and to fill the sections with standardized information. This script was created to run in the **Node JS** runtime environment.
